# pacmen
In this exercise, I move the Pacman image all around the screen and I check for when they hit the walls. They bounce back off each wall and move at random speeds.

How to run: Drag the html file onto a new tab in an internet browser. Click the add Pacman button and press the start game button. 

Ways to Improve: Add a points function where each time a Pacman bumps into a wall, points are added.
